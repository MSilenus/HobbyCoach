# HobbyCoach

HobbyCoach lets you keep track of your hobbies: it tries to get you to identify areas that need improvement, lets you define what exercise you need to do, and lets you keep abreast of what level you are at and what the next level is you'd like to attain next. It tries to get you to think of your hobby in measurable terms, and set realistic goals to reach. The process of identifying these areas, excercises and goals is managed using a GTD (Getting Things Done, David Allen) approach. Brainstorm about your hobby and where you want to take it, then assign contexts, define deadlines, or identify what steps need to be taken first to get there. This might involve thinking up exercises that you can measure improvement against.

I like to use a tablet, and since this is an open source effort, intended to be used or adapted freely, that means Android.
